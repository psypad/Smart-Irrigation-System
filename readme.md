# 🌾 AgroNet-4-BHARAT 🚜  
**Smart, Scalable, and Automated IoT-Based Precision Agriculture System for Indian Farmers**

---

## 🌟 Overview

AgroNet-4-BHARAT aims to revolutionize Indian agriculture by deploying a **Smart IoT-Based Farming System** that maximizes resource efficiency, enhances crop productivity, and fosters sustainability. By integrating **real-time monitoring**, **automated irrigation**, and **predictive analytics**, the system empowers farmers to make **data-driven decisions** with ease and reliability.

This project uses **ESP8266 microcontrollers**, environmental **IoT sensors**, **cloud-native containerization**, and **machine learning** to monitor and manage **soil moisture, temperature, and water usage**. AgroNet-4-BHARAT is designed to scale with ease, making it a robust solution for **small-scale farms** and **large agricultural estates** alike.

## 🧱 Scaling and Automation Strategy

### 🔄 Containerization
- Each ESP8266 controller's firmware logic is encapsulated in a **Docker container**.
- When a farmer adds a new board, the backend **provisions** the correct image and performs **Over-The-Air (OTA)** deployment.

### ☁️ Kubernetes Integration
- Kubernetes handles the **orchestration** of microservices.
- Features include:
  - Load balancing and autoscaling
  - Health checks and service discovery
  - Secure environment management via ConfigMaps and Secrets

### 🤖 AI Model Automation
- Machine learning model predicts future soil moisture based on:
  - Real-time sensor inputs
  - Weather data
  - Past irrigation records
- This model:
  - Sends irrigation triggers to control service
  - Updates dashboard forecasts
  - Adapts continuously based on new data
